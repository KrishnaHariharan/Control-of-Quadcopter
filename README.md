# Control-of-Quadcopter
Quadcopter is a non-linear system which makes it very difficult to control. Here PID control is implemented by linearizing the non - linear system in MATLAB SIMULINK
BATTERY, MOTOR & PROPELLER SELECTION:
DJI Maveric drone is taken as a reference for the dimensions, with little variation in the weight since we wheel, and wheel motors will be added in the drone rover. The size of the proposed system is expected to be at a weight of 1000g and the frontal area to 0.0197 m^2. The weight of the Maveric Pro drone is 0.743g. The diagonal length of the frames of the proposed system is to be 335mm.
